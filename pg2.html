    <h1>How to protect yourself</h1>
    <p>With the ever growing rate of technology, we have to adjust and learn how to protect our data and our privacy. Some small ways that you can protect yourself is by opting out of sharing your data with whatever app or technology you're using. For example, some apps don't necessarily need our personal data but they still ask for it regardless and if you feel as though it isn't necessary for you to put your personal information then don't! It is best to go case by case and how comfortable you feel with sharing your personal data. One other thing that you may do to protect your accounts and privacy is by finding a password manager that can help you keep track of passwords and update them on a regular basis so no one gets the edge on you and access your account without your consent. You can also set up a two-step authentication procedure where you connect your phone or email and before you're allowed to log in they send you a secure code to log-in successfully. It prevents people from logging into your account with just your password. Lastly, you can make your browsing experience simpler by installing an adblocker which would prevent companies from tracking your data while your browsing through sites and on top of that it'll get rid of those annoying popup ads that quite frankly ruin the browsing experience. These are just small examples of what you can do to protect your privacy for your sake and others. </p>

    <h2>What you can do? </h2>
    <p>Along with those helpful ideas, it is best to protect your computer with anti-virus software so that your PC doesn't carry harmful malware and malfunction over time. It will help your computer last and let you use your computer with an ease of mind knowing that it is being protected. It is also important that you update your technology because some updates fix loopholes that hackers found and by updating you're making sure they don't take advantage of you. Along with updating your technology or apps, it is also good to make sure you don't download sketchy software that mayb bring unwanted malware on your technology. As a safe measure, I would only download from your OSs' app store because they're usually vetted for security purposes and are more safe to use than unknown software or apps in the internet world. Lastly, be paranoid, it is best to question everything when it comes to downloading things from the internet or if someone sends you an email and it feels off, it is best to question everything so that these companies aren't using our data for the betterment of their business model or hackers aren't taking advantage of our naivity and collecting our personal infromation so that they can sell on the black market. As the advancement of technology grows, so should our awareness of these companies and their predatory practices. </p>
