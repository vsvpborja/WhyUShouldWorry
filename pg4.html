    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>I am an upcoming programming student that is trying to spread awareness of how invasive some companies are and how easy it is for them to access our information nowadays. As they become more pervasive and eager for our information we must retaliate with knowledge and the education of others. It is safe to assume that not everyone is very tech-savvy and sometimes need some help to fully understand what they're signing up for and what they're using. Technology is only gonna become more advanced and they're going to be able to take even more data than we think because of their advancement and we need to be more knowledgeable and prepared in order for us to protect ourselves. </p>
