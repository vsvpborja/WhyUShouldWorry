    <h1>Why data privacy is important? </h1>
    <p>Data privacy is important because if left unchecked it allows comapanies to cross boundaries that we as consumers would normally not allow them to cross. These comapanies track your internet footprint and use that info to bombard you with ads or they use it to refine their marketing plans which then would increase their predatory practices. It is great as consumers to be aware so that we don't fall for their predatory practices. It is our data, our information, and I personally believe our information shouldn't be shared without our consent and some companies believe that just because we use their app or technology that they're allowed to do what they want with our data. However, that is not the case, it is important for us to protect our data and hold these compaines in check. If it isn't gonna be the government, then it'll be us as consumers that'll hold these big companies in check and make sure they don't cross any more boundaries without any resistence.  </p>

    <h2>How to help?</h2>
    <p>In the current moment, there are many generations alive aho are using different apps and technologies and many are unaware of what they're signing up to. For example, it is safe to assume that the older generation just opt in to data tracking without any regard to what it means and how it can affect them. There's no reason for some apps to ask for our location or to track our data from different apps we use. When you really think about it, it doesn't make sense nor is there any need for them to request permission for things that don't correlate with the app. We must let people know of what they're signing up to and how it can affect their digital experience. We must give proper education when it comes to understanding what some people are opting in to or being able to understand the words that they're throwing at us while we are signing up for an app or new technology. We are trying to support a product or company yet they aren't doing the same for us by protecting us and our data. Where is the fairness in that?? We buy or down an app and they turn around and sell our data or ask for permission to access certain things for no logical reason. If it doesn't make sense to you as to why they're asking to access certain settings or content on your phone then don't agree to it. We must spread the word and educate others to become more aware of their digital footprint and how valuable it is to these comapanies and how we should protect our digital footprint unless we are also gonna be making money off of our personal data. It will be a long time before that can even occur ot it may never occur but we must still hold our digital footprint and be wary of how valuable it is and protect it for ourselves and others. </p>
